	<h1>My Notes Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 19, 2024</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy explains how "My Notes," a web application located at
		[https://notes.dejanvasic.me](https://notes.dejanvasic.me) (the "Application"), collects, uses,
		and protects your information.
	</p>

	<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
	<h3>Login Details:</h3>
	<p>
		The Application uses Email and Password as well as third party logins including Google through
		Auth0, a third-party authentication service, to manage user accounts. Through this integration,
		we may collect your basic user information like name and email address provided by Google. This
		information is **not** stored within the Application's database. It is solely used for user
		verification and access control.
	</p>

	<h3>Usage Data:</h3>
	<p>
		We may collect anonymized usage data to understand user behavior and improve the Application.
		This data could include information such as the number of active users, features accessed, and
		general browsing patterns. No personally identifiable information (PII) is tied to this data.
	</p>

	<h3>Note Content:</h3>
	<p>
		The Application allows users to store personal notes. However, the content of these notes is
		**fully encrypted** at rest within the database. We do not access, analyze, or utilize the
		content of your notes for any purpose. You retain complete ownership and control over your
		stored notes.
	</p>

	<h3>Cookies:</h3>
	<p>
		The Application may use a limited number of session cookies to facilitate user experience during
		your active session. These cookies are temporary and automatically deleted when you close your
		browser. We do not use cookies to track your activity beyond your current session or store any
		personal information.
	</p>

	<h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
	<p>
		We **do not** share your information with any third parties for marketing, advertising, or any
		other purposes beyond facilitating login through Google Sign-In via Auth0.
	</p>

	<h2>Your Rights</h2>
	<p>
		Since the Application does not store your personal data within its own database, there is no
		information to directly access or remove. However, you can manage your Google account
		information through Google's privacy settings.
	</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>
		We take reasonable precautions to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
		alteration, or destruction. User data is encrypted at rest within the database, and access to
		the database is restricted.
	</p>

	<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>
		We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant
		changes by posting the revised policy on the Application.
	</p>

	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as
		legal advice. While we strive to ensure its accuracy and completeness, you should consult with a
		legal professional for specific guidance on data privacy regulations.
